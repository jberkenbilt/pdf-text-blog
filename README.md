# PDF-Text Blog: Supplementary Material

This repository contains supplementary material for my three-part Blog series on understanding the
representation of text in PDF:
1. [Text in PDF: Prerequisites](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-prerequisites-df3dd3dfa9ea)
2. [Text in PDF: Basic](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-basic-1ce4cd8564f2)
3. [Text in PDF: Advanced](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-advanced-d13e68ba43ea)

# What's Here

The second and third posts each use sample PDF files. Here you can find an actual PDF file along
with a text file that, when opened in a text editor, looks like the PDF file's code. If you download
the original PDF and open it in a text editor that gracefully handles binary data (like emacs), you
can ignore the txt version. GitHub refuses to display a binary file, so the text files are copies of
the PDF files with binary streams redacted and other characters encoded in UTF-8 for display.

For [Text in PDF: Basic](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-basic-1ce4cd8564f2):
* [basic.pdf](basic.pdf) -- A PDF file with simple text using built-in fonts
* [basic.pdf.txt](basic.pdf.txt) -- A viewable text version

For [Text in PDF: Advanced](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-advanced-d13e68ba43ea):
* [advanced.pdf](advanced.pdf) -- A PDF file with non-Roman characters, emoji, and other features
* [advanced.pdf.txt](advanced.pdf.txt) -- A viewable text version

If you want to follow along with the blog posts or see PDF fragments in context, you can either
download the PDF and open it in a text/binary editor, or you can follow along with the text file
right from GitHub. The blogs are self-contained and included referenced fragments embedded as GitHub
gists.
