# PDF-Text Blog: Supplementary Material

This repository contains supplementary material for my five-part Blog series on understanding the
representation of text in PDF:
1. [Text in PDF: Introduction](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-introduction-df3dd3dfa9ea)
2. [Text in PDF: Basic Operators](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-basic-operators-1ce4cd8564f2)
3. [Text in PDF: Unicode](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-unicode-d13e68ba43ea)
4. [Text in PDF: Fonts and Spacing](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-fonts-and-spacing-eae6fd8d2b40)
5. [Text in PDF: Non-Latin Alphabets](https://medium.com/@jberkenbilt/text-in-pdf-non-latin-alphabets-2edd88884b68)

# What's Here

These posts use sample PDF files. Here you can find an actual PDF file along with a text file that,
when opened in a text editor, looks like the PDF file's code. If you download the original PDF and
open it in a text editor that gracefully handles binary data (like emacs), you can ignore the txt
version. GitHub refuses to display a binary file, so the text files are copies of the PDF files with
binary streams redacted and other characters encoded in UTF-8 for display. The posts link directly
to lines in the txt file, but in all cases within the blog, the line numbers match up.

For Part 2:
* [basic.pdf](basic.pdf) -- A PDF file with simple text using built-in fonts
* [basic.pdf.txt](basic.pdf.txt) -- A viewable text version

For Parts 3 through 5:
* [advanced.pdf](advanced.pdf) -- A PDF file with non-Latin characters, emoji, and other features
* [advanced.pdf.txt](advanced.pdf.txt) -- A viewable text version

If you want to follow along with the blog posts or see PDF fragments in context, you can either
download the PDF and open it in a text/binary editor, or you can follow along with the text file
right from GitHub. The blogs are self-contained and included referenced fragments embedded as GitHub
gists.
